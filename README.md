# ANALYSIS OF HOME ADVANTAGE IN THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE

## Goals
A few months ago I watched [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNy5XBae9Eg) about home court advantage in the NBA and really appreciated how he quantified this advantage and measured its causes. I watch a lot of soccer (or football) and wanted to see if these same methods could be applied to the English top flight.

My basic methodology was to find soccer equivalents of all the statistics from MacKelvie's video and see if they followed the same trends as the basketball statistics.

| Basketball Statistic (from video) | Soccer Statistic          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Win % Difference                  | Home Points - Away Points |
| Home vs Away Point Differential   | Home GD - Away GD         |
| Travel Amount Before a Game       | Method described below    |
| Calls that benefit home team      | Yellow cards              |
| Open 3 Shooting                   | xG overperformance        |
